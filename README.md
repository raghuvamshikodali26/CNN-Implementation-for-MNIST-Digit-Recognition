# CNN-Implementation-for-MNIST-Digit-Recognition
# Abstract:
* This repository contains the code and documentation for a project on handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to develop and evaluate a CNN model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers with softmax activation for classification.

# Contents:
* Code: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* Data: Includes the MNIST dataset used for training and testing the CNN model.
* Documentation: Contains project overview, requirements, implementation details, and analysis results.
* Results: Includes visualizations and metrics generated during model training and evaluation.
* References: Contains references to academic papers, books, and online resources used in the project.
